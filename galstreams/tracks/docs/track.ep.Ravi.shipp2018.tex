The celestial track was implemented as the great circle arc (of minimum length) with end points reported by \citet{Shipp2018}. The distance track was implemented by linearly interpolating the distances reported by the authors for the end points.  The stream's coordinate  frame is implemented from the coefficients for the rotation matrix reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~5 (Appendix C). The proper motion track was implemented using the mean by-eye proper motion measurement for the stream in observed ICRS coordinates, reported in \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table 3.  
The InfoFlag for the proper motion in this case is thus set to 2 to reflect the proper motion track is available but is an approximation.
