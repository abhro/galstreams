The celestial track was implemented as the great circle arc (of minimum length) with galactocentric pole, mid-point coordinates and length as reported by \citet{Mateu2018}. The mean galactocentric distance reported by the authors was adopted for the full track. The coordinates were transformed back to the heliocentric frame assuming $R_\odot=-8.5$~kpc, as adopted by the authors.
