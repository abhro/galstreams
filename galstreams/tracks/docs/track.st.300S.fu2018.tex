The celestial, distance and radial velocity tracks were read-off the orbital fit 
shown by \citet{Fu2018} in their Figure 10. Note that the stream members observed and confirmed spectroscopically by \citet{Fu2018} and, thus, the orbital fit, produce a sky track that differs slightly from the one reported in an earlier follow-up by \citet{Bernard2016}. At both ends the \citet{Bernard2016}  track is slightly south of the one in \citet{Fu2018}. 
They also note their reported track was restricted to the area where the stream is most prominent, 
therefore being shorter than that in \citet{Bernard2016}.
