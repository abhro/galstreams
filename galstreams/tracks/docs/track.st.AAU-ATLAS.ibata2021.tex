The stream's celestial, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table. This track corresponds to that reported by \citet{Ibata2021} for the ATLAS stream, it is asociated to the ATLAS branch of the ATLAS-AliqaUma (AAU) stream.
