The ATLAS-AliqaUma (AAU) stream is argued by \citet{Li2021} to be a single feature that includes the previously
identified ATLAS \citep{Koposov2014} and AliqaUma streams \citep{Shipp2018}. The S5 spectroscopic survey of the region
shows it is discontinuous in the sky, but continuous in distance, proper motion and radial velocity.

Because of the sharp discontinuity in the sky, we have implemented it as two separate tracks: AAU-ATLAS and AAU-AliqaUMA.
The sky tracks are given by Eq. 3 by \citet{Li2021}, the distance modulus track is given by their Eq.~2 and the radial velocity and proper motion tracks are given in their Eq. 1. The radial velocity was converted back from GSR to LSR assuming the solar and LSR 
used by the authors and provided in their Sec.1. The proper motions given by their Eq.~1 do not include the solar reflex motion correction.

The coordinate frame for the stream (for the two branches) is implemented using the rotation matrix provided by \citet{Li2021},
but note the resulting $\phi_1$ is flipped with respect to \citet{Li2021} (i.e. $\phi_1=-\phi_1^{L21}$).
