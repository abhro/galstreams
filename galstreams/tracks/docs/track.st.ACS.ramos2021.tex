The ACS (AntiCentre Stream) proper motion tracks implemented are the median tracks in Fig. 5 of \citet[][data provided by P. Ramos priv. comm.]{Ramos2021}. The celestial track corresponds to the smoothed spline that better represents the mean Galactic latitude of the HEALpix where these structures are detected, as a function of galactic longitude. The authors report a single mean distance of 11.7~kpc adopted here for the full track. 

Although initially thought to be a tidal stream, like in the case of Monoceros (see Monoceros-R21), a fair consensus has been reached that ACS is most likely a feature produced by stars perturbed out of the Galactic disc \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{Laporte2019a,Laporte2019b,Ramos2021}. As for Monoceros, we have chosen to keep it in the library given that its signature is localised in both the sky and proper motion spaces, and well represented
by a simple track in each.
