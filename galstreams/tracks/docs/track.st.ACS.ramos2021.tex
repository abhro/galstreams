The ACS proper motion tracks implemented are the median tracks in Fig. 5 of \citet[][data provided by P. Ramos priv. comm.]{Ramos2021}. The celestial track corresponds to the smoothed spline that better represents the mean Galactic latitude of the HEALpix where these structures are detected, as a function of galactic longitude. The authors report a single mean distance of 11.7~kpc adopted here for the full track.
