The celestial track was implemented from the polynomial fit provided by \citet{Grillmair2013} in their Eq.~1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha = 32.116-0.00256\delta-0.00225\delta^2
\end{eqnarray*}

with $\delta \in [-69^\circ,-45^\circ]$. The authors report mean heliocentric distances of 2 and 1.6~kpc respectively for the southern and northern parts of the stream. We assume these distances to correspond to the ends of the stream and use linear interpolation to give a first approximation to the distance gradient.
