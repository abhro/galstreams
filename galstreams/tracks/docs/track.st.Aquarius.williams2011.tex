The celestial, distance, proper motion and radial velocity tracks for the Aquarius stream were implemented by fitting second degree polynomials to the stream members reported by \citet{Williams2011} in their Tables~1 and 3. The $d_R$ distances were used, as recommended by the authors. These were derived using Reduced Proper Motions and assuming a tangential velocity of 250~km/s for the stream stars. Although proper motions from PPMXL are reported by the authors in their Table~1, for consistency among the library, we have used Gaia EDR3 proper motions retrieved by matching the reported members to Gaia EDR3 with a $0\fdg5$ tolerance. For the radial velocity track we used the line-of-sight heliocentric velocity $V_{los}$ reported by the authors in their Table~1.
