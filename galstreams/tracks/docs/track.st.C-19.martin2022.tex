The celestial and proper motion tracks for the C-19 stream are implemented by fitting a second degree polynomial to the potential member stars reported in Table 1 of \citet{Martin2022}. The mean distance of 18~kpc adopted by the authors in their analysis is assumed here for the full stream, as Gaia EDR3 parallaxes are not informative enough at such large distances. A mean heliocentric radial velocity of is assumed for the full stream, computed from the stars reported in Table 2 of \citet{Martin2022}.
