The celestial, distance and proper motion tracks were obtained by fitting third order polynomials to stars in the Cetus-New wrap identified by \citet[][data provided by Z. Yuan priv. comm.]{Yuan2021}. We have restricted the fit to members with $\delta<0\degr$ to avoid the sharp discontinuity in the track introduced by a few members at $\delta\sim20\degr$, clearly separated from the rest in declination, and which would require a much higher order polynomial to fit the track and introduce seemingly unphysical wiggles.  We therefore caution the track is not representative of the stream members at $\delta\sim20\degr$ reported by \citet{Yuan2021}.
