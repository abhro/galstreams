The celestial, distance and proper motion tracks were obtained by fitting a third order polynomial to the Blue Horizontal Branch star members identified by \citet[][data provided by G. Thomas  priv. comm.]{Thomas2021}. The distances provided for these stars are photometric standard-candle distances, computed by the authors as described in Sec. 4.2.1. of \citet{Thomas2021}. 
The stream's reference frame is an auto-computed great-circle frame, with origin at $(\alpha,\delta)=(22\fdg 11454259,-6\fdg 7038421)$ as recommended in their Sec. 4.1. We have chosen this for consistency along the library, since all refence frames used are great-circle ones. We do caution that \citet{Thomas2021} report their $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ coordinates in a small-circle frame, in which the stream lies at $\phi_2\sim 0\degr$, corresponding to a plane offset by $14\fdg 36$ from the great-circle plane with the same pole $(\alpha,\delta)=(125\fdg 1809832,15\fdg 91290743)$.
