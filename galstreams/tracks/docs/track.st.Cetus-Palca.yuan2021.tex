The celestial, distance and proper motion tracks were obtained by fitting a fifth order polynomial to the Blue Horizontal Branch stars, K giants and Cetus-Palca wrap samples from \citet[][data provided by Z. Yuan priv. comm.]{Yuan2021}. The fit was restricted to $\alpha<200\degr$ to ensure it's stability, since stars at larger right ascension make the track multi-valued in the stream's reference frame. Therefore, we caution the reader the stream track may extend beyond $\alpha\sim 200\degr$. The authors also identified a new wrap of the Cetus stream, dubbed by the authors as the Cetus-New wrap, we implement this separately under that name.
