The Cetus stream (or Cetus Polar stream) celestial, distance and radial velocity tracks are implemented from the 
reference points reported by \citet{Yam2013} in their Table~1, taking the mean of the galactic latitude range reported in each row. 

\citet{Yam2013} report radial velocities in the GSR frame. The solar parameters used to convert the observed radial velocities to the GSR are not explicitly reported, hence, to revert back to the heliocentric frame and compute the observed radial velocity we assume a solar peculiar velocity of $(U,V,W)_\odot=(11.1,12.24,7.25)$~km/s with respecto to the LSR from \citet{Schoenrich2010} and $V_{LSR}=220$~km/s from \citet{DehnenBinney1998}, available and widely used at the time.
