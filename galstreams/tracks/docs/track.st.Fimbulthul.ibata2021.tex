The stream's celestial, distance and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table. \citet{Ibata2019_OCen} argue that Fimbulthul is part of a stream generated by the $\omega$ Centauri globular cluster. Note that the reported track does not link up to the cluster itself.
