This version of the GD-1 stream's celestial, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks was implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table.
