The celestial track for Hyllus was implemented from the polynomial fit provided by \citet{Grillmair2014} in their Eq.~1:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha = 255.8150 - 0.78364\delta + 0.01532\delta^2
\end{eqnarray*}

with $\delta \in [11^\circ,34^\circ]$. These limits in declination are not given explicitly in \citet{Grillmair2014}, so they were taken from the compilation in Table~4.1 of \citet{GrillmairCarlin2016}. The authors report mean heliocentric distances of 18.5 and 23~kpc respectively for the northern and southern ends of the stream. We assume these distances to correspond to the ends of the stream and use linear interpolation in between.
