The stream's celestial and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a second degree polynomial using the ICRS data for the stream members reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~7 (Appendix E). The distance track was implemented using the mean distance of 16.6~kpc from \citet{Shipp2018} for the full track. The stream's coordinate frame is implemented from the coefficients for the rotation matrix reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~5 (Appendix C). The radial velocity track was implemented by matching the \citet{Shipp2019} members to the radial velocity catalogue from \citet{Li2022} and fitting a second degree polynomial. The track is limited to the $\phi_1$ range spanned by the members with measured radial velocities and set to ~1000 km/s outside this range to avoid extrapolating outside the coverage of the observations.
