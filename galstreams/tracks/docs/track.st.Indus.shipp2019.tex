The stream's celestial and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a second degree polynomial using the ICRS data for the stream members reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~7 (Appendix E). The distance track was implemented using the mean distance of 16.6~kpc from \citet{Shipp2018} for the full track. The stream's coordinate frame is implemented from the coefficients for the rotation matrix reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~5 (Appendix C).
