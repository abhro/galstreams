The stream's celestial, distance and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting third degree polynomials to the ICRS data for the stream members reported by \citet{Ferguson2022} in their Table~3. As noted by the authors, distances reported in the table were computed according to their Eq.~3, based on the distance modulus gradient observed for Blue Horizontal Branch stars identified in the stream. The stream's coordinate frame is implemented using the rotation matrix provided in their Eq.~1, coinciding with the frame defined in \citet{Jethwa2018}.
