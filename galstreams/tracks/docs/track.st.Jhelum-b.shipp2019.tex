The stream's celestial and proper motions tracks for Jhelum-a and Jhelum-b were implemented by fitting a first degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~7 (Appendix E). The distance track was implemented using the mean distance of 13.2~kpc from \citet{Shipp2018} for the full track for both components. The same stream's coordinate frame is implemented for both branches, from the coefficients for the rotation matrix reported for Jhelum by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~5 (Appendix C).
