The celestial track for Kwando was implemented from the polynomial fit provided by \citet{Grillmair2017_south} in their Eq. 5:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta = -7.817 -2.354\alpha +0.1202\alpha^2 -0.00215\alpha^3 
\end{eqnarray*}

with $\alpha \in [+19^\circ,+31^\circ]$, as explicitly reported by the authors. The authors report a FWHM of 22 arcmin corresponding to a physical width of 130~pc, which corresponds to a heliocentric distance of $\approx$20~kpc. This mean distance was adopted for the full track.
