The celestial and proper motion tracks for the LMS-1 stream were implemented by fitting a fifth degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Malhan2021} in their Table 1, with proper motions retrieved directly from a cross-match to Gaia EDR3 with $0.5$ arcsec tolerance. For the full stream we have assumed the mean distance of 19~kpc  calculated  by \citet{Malhan2021} from the Gaia EDR3 uncertainty weighed mean parallax, since at these large distances Gaia EDR3 parallaxes are too uncertain to be informative. Note there are no common stars between these and the RR Lyrae and Blue Horizontal Branch stars from \citet{Yuan2020} used to implement the LMS1-Y20 track.
