The stream's celestial, distance and proper motion tracks were implemented by fitting a five degree polynomial to the stream RR Lyrae and Blue Horizontal Branch members reported by \citet{Yuan2020} (private communication). Note these have no stars in common with those reported by \citet{Malhan2021} used to implement the LMS1-M21 track. We have chosen to implement these two tracks separately as they derived from different stellar population tracers.
