The celestial and proper motion tracks were obtained by fitting fifth order polynomials to stream members reported by \citet{Grillmair2022} in their Tables 1 and 2, limited to members with weights larger than 0.2 to avoid an apparent bifurcation of the stream at $\alpha\sim 330\degr$. The tables do not include distance estimates, and this information could not be extracted from their Fig. 4, which does seem to show a strong distance gradient ranging from $\sim20$ to $7$~kpc from east to west along the stream. We have adopted the mean distance to the cluster (11.693~kpc) from \citet{Baumgardt2021} as cited by the author, but caution this should \emph{not} provide a good approximation. The InfoFlag for the distance in this case is thus set to 0 accordingly.
