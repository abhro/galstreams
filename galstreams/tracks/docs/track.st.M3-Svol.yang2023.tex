The stream's celestial, proper motions and radial velocity tracks were implemented by fitting a second degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Yang2023} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented by linearly interpolating between the reference points extracted from their Figure 10. The authors show this stream appears to be related to the Sv\"ol stream from \citet{Ibata2021}, as first suggested by \citet{Bonaca2021}, and confirmed by the celestial, distance and proper motion tracks of the two streams. Note, however, that the radial velocities reported by \citet{Yang2023} and \citet{Ibata2021} appear inconsistent.
