The stream's celestial track was implemented by fitting a fifth degree polynomial to knots along the tail detected by \citet[][data provided by A. Sollima in priv. comm]{Sollima2020}. The author's methodology used Gaia DR2 parallaxes in their inference, but the distances are not provided explicitly in the paper. Here the track was implemented using the most recent cluster distance from \citet{Baumgardt2021}.
