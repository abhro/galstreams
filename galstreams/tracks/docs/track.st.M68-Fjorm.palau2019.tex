This version of the M68 stream's celestial, distance and proper motion tracks were implemented using the candidate stars reported by \citet{Palau2019} in their Table E1 and fitting a third degree polynomial to the data in each coordinate. For the computation of the distance track we assumed the reciprocal of the parallax reported in the table as a distance estimator and excised stars with negative parallaxes and parallaxes $<0.05$~mas, which are clear outliers. We have set the distance InfoFlag to '2' to reflect this estimate should be taken with caution.
