The M92 celestial track was implemented using the polynomial fit provided by \citet{Thomas2020} in tangent plane coordinates:

\[ \eta = -0.134 +0.041\xi -0.056\xi^2 +0.001\xi^3 \] 

where $-7^\circ<\xi<+9\fdg5$ and $\eta$ are given in degrees, and point West and North following the usual convention. The tangent plane transformation assumes the cluster as the center of projection. We convert $(\xi,\eta)$ to equatorial coordinates following standard procedure \citep[e.g. see Chapter 9 in][]{BB2005}. Finally, for the distance track we assume for the whole track the mean distance of $8.3$~kpc, reported by the authors in their Table~1, as no distance gradient is reported.
