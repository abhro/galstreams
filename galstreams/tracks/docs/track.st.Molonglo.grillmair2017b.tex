The celestial track for Molonglo was implemented from the polynomial fit provided by \citet{Grillmair2017_south} in their 
Eq.~2:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha = 345.017 - 0.5843\delta + 0.0182\delta^2
\end{eqnarray*}

with $\delta \in [-24\fdg5,-12^\circ]$, as explicitly reported by the authors. The authors report a mean heliocentric distance of 20~kpc for the stream and FWHM of 30 arcmin, we assume this mean value for the whole distance track.
