The stream's celestial, distance and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table. The authors show this stream is associated to the NGC~3201 cluster.
