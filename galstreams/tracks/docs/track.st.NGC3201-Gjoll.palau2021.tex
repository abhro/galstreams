The NGC3201 stream's celestial, distance and proper motion tracks are implemented using the candidate stars reported by \citet{Palau2021} in their Table~C1 and fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the data in each coordinate. The distance track was computed assuming the reciprocal of the parallax as a distance estimator and excising stars with negative parallaxes and 
parallaxes $<0.05$~mas, which are clear outliers.
