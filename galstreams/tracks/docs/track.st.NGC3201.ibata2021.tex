The stream's celestial, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table.

The detection presented in \citet{Ibata2021} corresponds to the stellar stream's detection around the cluster position. The authors argue the Gj\"oll stream is the continuation of the cluster's tails further towards the Galactic anti-center, based on the agreement between the NGC3201 stream and Gj\"oll detections with an orbital fit based on two stars of the cluster's stream.
