In the previous version of \galstreams, the NGC~5466 stream track was realised by interpolating between the stream's end points
reported by \citet{Grillmair2006_5466} in their  Fig.~1 caption and using the cluster's position from the
\citet[][2010 edition]{Harris1996} catalogue as a central point.

For this realization of the NGC~5466 stream's celestial track, we read-off points along the dot-dashed lined in Figure 2 of \citet{Grillmair2006_5466}. The authors report a width of $1\fdg4$ and a mean heliocentric distance of 16.6~kpc adopted here for the full stream.

It is interesting to note that \citet{Weiss2018} report three detections nearly parallel to the stream but about $\sim 5^\circ$ south of the NGC~5466 stream reported by \citet{Grillmair2006_5466}. These are not included here.
