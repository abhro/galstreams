The celestial and proper motion tracks were implemented by fitting a fifth degree polynomial to the members published in Table~2 of \citet{Caldwell2020} with membership probabilities $P_\mathrm{mem}>0.5$. The distance track was implemented using the mean distance for the full stream, calculated as the reciprocal of the mean weighted parallax of $0.12 \pm 0.01$~mas obtained by the authors for high probability members ($P_\mathrm{mem}>0.9$) with parallax errors $<0.5$~mas. We caution that there probably is a significant distance gradient in the stream, since the authors note \citet{Sesar2015} already observed a distance gradient of $\sim1.5$~kpc over $\sim2\degr$, consistent with their observed color-magnitud diagrams.
