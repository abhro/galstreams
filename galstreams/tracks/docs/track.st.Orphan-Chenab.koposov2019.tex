The sky, distance, $\mu_{\phi_1}$ and radial velocity tracks for the Orphan stream are implemented from the knots
reported in Tables C1-C3 and Table 4 of \citet{Koposov2019}, respectively. 
The coordinate frame adopted and supplied with \galstreams\ is that provided by \citet{Koposov2019} in their Appendix B.
The authors report the solar-reflex corrected $\mu_{\phi_1}$ proper motion and radial velocity in the GSR frame,
for which the Sun's peculiar velocity $V_{LSR}=240$\kms from \citet{Schoenrich2010} and position $R_\odot=8.34$kpc 
from \citet{Reid2014} were adopted. We use these values to add back the solar reflex contribution and report all quantities in the heliocentric frame. Radial velocities reported by the authors are limited to $50^\circ<\phi_1<120^\circ$ (corresponding to 
$141\fdg21<\alpha<167\fdg75$), outside this range we have set the radial velocity track to zero.

The $\mu_{\phi_2}$ proper motion track was obtained from the RR Lyrae stream members provided in Table~5 of \citet{Koposov2019}. Their Gaia~DR2 \citep{GaiaCol_2018_DR2_survey} proper motions were retrieved from the Gaia Archive, converted into the stream's coordinate frame and the 
$\mu_{\phi_2}$ track obtained by fitting a 10-degree polynomial.
