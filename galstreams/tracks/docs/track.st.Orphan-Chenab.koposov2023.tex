The sky, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks for the Orphan-Chenab stream are implemented from the knots
reported in the correspoding tables provided in Appendix C of \citet{Koposov2023}.
The coordinate frame adopted and supplied with \galstreams\ is that provided by \citet{Koposov2019} in their Appendix B.
The authors report the solar-reflex corrected radial velocity in the GSR frame, which was corrected back to the heliocentric
frame using the Solar peculiar velocity and LSR values cited by the authors in their Sec.~3.1
