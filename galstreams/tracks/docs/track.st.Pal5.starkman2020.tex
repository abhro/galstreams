Only the celestial track is implemented for the stream in this case, based on the anchor points (black circles) shown in Fig.~7 of \citet{Starkman2020}. Since there is no distance gradient information used in this study, we have set the mean distance of 22.5~kpc for the full stream. Although there is 5D information available for the Pal~5 stream from previous studies \citep{PriceWhelan2019_pal5,Ibata2021}, we include it since this study has traced the leading tail by $\sim7\degr$ beyond previously known limits.
