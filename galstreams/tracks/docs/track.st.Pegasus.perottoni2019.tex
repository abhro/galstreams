The Pegasus stream celestial track was implemented by fitting a third degree polynomial to the end points reported 
by \citet{Perottoni2019} in their Table 1, plus a few points read-off of their Figure 2, in order to avoid assuming the track is well aproximated by a great circle. The authors report a heliocentric distance of 18~kpc for the full stream, which we adopt here for the distance track.
