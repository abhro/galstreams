The Sagittarius stream's celestial and proper motion tracks implemented are those derived by \citet{Antoja2020} coupled with the distance track from \citet{Ramos2020} corresponding to their RR Lyrae stars' Strip sample. To implement these we have used the polynomial interpolators provided by the authors in the GitHub repository Brugalada\footnote{\url{https://github.com/brugalada/Sagittarius}}.

In the previous version of \galstreams\ the Sagittarius stream footprint had been implemented by supplying a realisation of the \citet{LawMajewski2010} model in a spherical potential. We have chosen to implement the new track based on \citet{Antoja2020} and \citet{Ramos2020} as these correspond to nearly all-sky (except for the Galactic disc crossing) blind detections made with direct observables with no prior Sagittarius model information. This way, in terms of track implementation, Sagittarius stands on equal footing as the rest of the streams.
