The celestial, proper motion and radial velocity tracks are implemented from a linear fit of the seven stars from Table 1 of Chandra2022, which the authors report as 6 bona fide members and one probable member of the stream. The member stars do not have individual distances reported, therefore, the mean distance of 12.5kpc is assumed to implement the distance track. The stream's coordinate frame used is defined by the pole and centre reported by the authors in their Sec 2.2.
