The stream's celestial, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table. This track corresponds to the Sv\"ol stream reported in \citet{Ibata2021}. This appears to be related to the M3 (NGC5272) cluster, as first suggested by \citet{Bonaca2021} and confirmed by the M3 stream found by \citet{Yang2023} based on its celestial, distance and proper motion track. Note, however, that the radial velocities reported by \citet{Yang2023} and \citet{Ibata2021} appear inconsistent.
