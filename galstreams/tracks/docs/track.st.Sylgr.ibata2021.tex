The stream's celestial, distance, proper motions and radial velocity tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table.  The members used to implement the radial velocity track in this version include those from \citet{Ibata2019} (Table~1) previously used to implement it in a more limited range.

The radial velocity track was implemented by fitting a polynomial to the radial velocities of stars reported as probable members in Table~1 of \citet{Ibata2019}. The radial velocity is set to zero outside the range spanned by the member stars. The last InfoFlag bit is set to `2' to reflect that the radial velocity is available but does not span the full length of the track.
