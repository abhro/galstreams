The stream's celestial, distance and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a seventh degree polynomial to the stream members reported by \citet{Ibata2021} in their Table~1. The distance track was implemented using the distance computed by the authors and readily provided in the table.  The radial velocity track was implemented by fitting a polynomial to the radial velocities of stars reported as probable members in Table~1 of \citet{Ibata2019}. The radial velocity is set to zero outside the range spanned by the member stars. The last InfoFlag bit is set to `2' to reflect that the radial velocity is available but does not span the full length of the track.
