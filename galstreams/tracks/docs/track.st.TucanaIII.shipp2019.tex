The stream's celestial and proper motions tracks were implemented by fitting a second degree polynomial using the ICRS data for the stream members reported by \citet{Shipp2019} in their Table~7 (Appendix E). The distance track was implemented by a linear interpolation between the end points and distances reported in \citet{Shipp2018}.The stream's coordinate frame is implemented from the coefficients for the rotation matrix reported by \citet{Li2018}, which makes the origin of the coordinate frame centred on the stream's progenitor.
